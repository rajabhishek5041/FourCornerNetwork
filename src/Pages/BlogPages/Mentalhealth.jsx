                WORLD MENTAL HEALTH DAY <br />
              </span>
              Every year on October 10th, the world observes World Mental Health
              Day to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and promote mental
              well-being. As mental health becomes an increasing global concern,
              this day reminds us that mental health is just as important as
              physical health. While the theme may change each year, the core
              message is clear: mental health matters, and everyone deserves
              access to support and care.
